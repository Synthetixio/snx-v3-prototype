## Synthetix V3 Prototype

To get started, first install dependencies at the root level:

```
npm install
```

Then, to use the peripheral package for testing and development, build the [Cannonfile](https://usecannon.com/) and run the local node:

```
npm run cannon-build
npm run local-chain
```

Finally, start the front-end application:

```
npm run dev
```
